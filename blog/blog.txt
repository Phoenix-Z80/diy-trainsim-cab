Have just created teh repo on GitHub in order to keep track of design ideas and to also add the code that will be required for this controller to be used. Although no code currently exists I am aware that teh tool I've seen working for users on YouTube uses Auto Hot Key (AHK) to draw the possitions of connected controllers and to simulate key presses. Train Simulator (at the time of writing) does not have native analogue functionality. It has the facility for it to be used with a game controller, but no analoge controllers are recognised or can be selected to be used. Hence the need for some application and a config file to be used. The next stage is to draw up some examples of controller leyouts and research the use of my existing analogue controllers with this software (I can't remember what it is called just now).
